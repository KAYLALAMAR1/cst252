<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>It was challenging to create a list about how to do a certain task and
	make sure it could be easily followed. I chose to write about a game most
people know about. Then I chose a task that every player should know. I the
same time, I didn't want to have too many steps and it end up being too
complicated. So, I tried to keep to keep everything more concise.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>While completing this lab, I had a problem with adding the javascript
	comments to the html file. I wasn't sure if I should include the backslashes
	or not. I ultimately decided to not include them. Instead, I used the ordered
	list tag to create a numbered list for each step. Then, I changed the div
	height so it would include all the text. The Results are shown below.</p>
