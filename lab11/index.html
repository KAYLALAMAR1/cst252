      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I found the javascript code to be challenging. Trying to get the details
        just right was a bit complicated but I was able to push through.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>With this lab, I had a problem with the javascript source code. The
        text box and submit button showed up, but when I pressed the sumbit button,
        nothing happened. There wasn't even a space for the results.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I fixed this problem by comparing my code to the one in the example. I
    realized that I made a couple of typos in the newText part and quickly
    corrected the errors. The results of this lab can be found below where there
    is an input text box and a submit button. To see the deatils of the source
    code, open the javascript console.</p>
