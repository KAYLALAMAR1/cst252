      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was challenging to transfer the javascript code from a function to a
        class. I did run into a couple of problems, but I managed to fix them.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>With this lab, I had a problem with getting the information of the
        first car (the Honda Civic) to appear. At the same time, The header that
        says "Script Output" dissapeared. When I checked the javascript console
      there weren't any erros reported.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I fixed this problem by making a second output div for the first car to
    appear under. This allowed both of the cars to show up on the website. But I
    still had the problem with the "Script Output" header not appearing. So, I
    simply just moved it outside the div and put it at the top. Right in between
    the results section and the first output div. The results of this lab can be
    found below where it says "Script Output" under the results section.</p>
