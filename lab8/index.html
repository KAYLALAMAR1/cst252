    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>When doing this lab, it was a bit challenging to name everything coorectly.
    I did get a little consused with naming the array, variable, and function.
    I had to be extra careful with writing out the javascript source code in
    both the console and Atom.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>During this lab I didn't have any problems, just the challenges listed
      above. I followed the instructions and tested the source code out to make
      sure it was working. If there were any problems I had, it was very minor
      such as forgetting a bracket or semicolon.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results of this lab can be seen in the javascript console. By going
      to View > Developer > Javascript Console, you can see the code I used on
      the right hand side of the screen.</p>
