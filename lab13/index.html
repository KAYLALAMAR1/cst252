      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was challenging for me to display the screenshots I took of the
        results on this webpage. I struggled for a bit, and it definitely proved
      to be quite the challenge. As for the debugging portion of the lab,
      everything went smoothly. So, that wasn't too challenging.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>With this lab, I had a problem with adding the screenshots to my website.
      When I put the screenshots in, there were many problems I didn't like. The
    images were stacked instead of side by side. The screenshot captions were
  scattered around the images. They were too small, not centered, and the div
  couldn't fit them. I looked up multiple possible solutions and even looked
  back at source codes for past labs from CST351. But nothing was working.</p>

<div id="content">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Eventually I found out about table tags. Once I put these into my html file,
    the images actually appeared side by side! I centered the images by adjusting
    the margin values and width percentages. The only thing I couldn't figure
    out -and didn't have any mental energy left to try and figure out- was how
    to make the output images on the left bigger. The results of my work can be
    found below where it says "Debugging". There are also 2 sets of images for
    each lab that I decided to debug.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>For each of my past labs, I had already checked the javascript console to
  make sure there weren't any reported errors. If I found any, I imediately
  fixed them before submitting the assignment. However, that does not mean
  there weren't any typos I might have missed. So, I decided to go back to lab 11
  and check to see if there were any errors that could have been messing up the
  code. I added debugger to a line so it will pause and check the code. I
  proceeded to do the same thing for lab 7. Luckily, neither of the labs had any
  errors that needed to be corrected. The images below show the javascript code
  in Atom for each lab as well as how the webpages react with debugger in the code.</p>
