      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was challenging for me to do the javascript code because I was unsure
        if the page should show the results, or if it's just in the console.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I didn't really have any problems with this lab. I was was just a bit
        confused about how the results should look. I used Wes's website as a
        guide and saw that it's just the button and text box that shows. So I
        just completed the lab knowing this information.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The results of this lab can be found at the buttom of the page where
          there is a text box and a submit button next to it.</p>
