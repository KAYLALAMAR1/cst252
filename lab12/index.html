      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was challenging to organize the elements. I was unsure of if the
        organization affected the output in any way, so I just decided to follow
        the assignment decription as closely as I could, even if the code I used
        appears a little different. </p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>With this lab, I had a problem with the loops portion of the javascript code. I
        used the code that my group did during breakout rooms, but I noticed
        there were a couple of errors and the multiples were incomplete. I
        finished the rest of the multiples, corrected the errors, and checked
        the javascript console to make sure it was working.</p>

  <p>The results can be found in the javascript console of this webpage.</p>
