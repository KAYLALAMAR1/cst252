<h2>Subject of Lab</h2>
<p>The subject of this lab was to edit the file structure of the CST252 folder
	and add html and css files to the homepage and lab 3 folders.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>While completing this lab, I struggled with preparing the file structure.
	The template already came with html files in each of the folders. So I wasn't
	sure if I should delete them or not, because I would have to just create them
	again.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I overcame this challenge by deciding to just leave the index folders there.
	I didn't want to delete them considering I'll most likely use them in the future.
	This website displays the outcome of my work from the links, to divs,
	to the text, and even an image.</p>
