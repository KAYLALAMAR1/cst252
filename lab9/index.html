      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was challenging for me to organize and figure out the javascript code.
        Luckily, I was able to finish writing the code after using the provided
        resources.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>While working on this lab, I had a problem with the javascript code.
      Once I figured out the code, the file was still not working. When I checked
    the console, it said there was an error with the variable. It turns out I
  forgot to put a braket at the top of the code. I proceeded to fix the error
  and the code began working properly.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>You can see the results of my work at the bottom of this webpage. Also, if
  you open the javascript console, the deatils are shown there as well.</p>
