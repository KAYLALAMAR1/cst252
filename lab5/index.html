<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>I found that it was a challenge to do the output section of the javascript
	file for lab 5. This is due to me making typos and incorrectly reading the
	examples. But I was able to quickly overcome this challenge by taking my time
	with inputting the code and checking the webpage in my local browser.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>While completing this lab, I had problems with the javascript consol on my
	browser. This was because I kept making typos like forgetting the semicolon
	and the parentheses. On top of that, the ownIt part of the code was giving
	me a lot of trouble for a couple of reasons. The assignment description didn't
	specify what variable to put on the other side of the equal sign and what
	order they should be in. That was the most stressful part of this lab because
if I made a mistake, I had to start all over again.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I was able to fix this problem by trial and error. I just kept trying to get
	it right. It took countless tries and a lot of time. Eventually, I got was
	able to finish task one and took the screenshot of the console. The same
	variables I declared there, are in the javascript file for this lab. So the
	results of my work are a the bottom of this webpage.</p>
