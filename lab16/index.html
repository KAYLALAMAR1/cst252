      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>It was challenging to create a button in jQuery. I knew how to create
      one in html but not in a javascript file. I was having a lot of trouble.
      But managed to find a way to create the button and label it.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>With this lab, I had a problem with the entire jQuery code. Nothing was
        working and the resources weren't helping at all including the lecture
        slides and forums. I was able to get the button to show up, but it would disappear
      sometimes. I also couldn't get the alert to show up when I clicked the
      button instead of when the page loaded.</p>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I fixed this problem by meeting with my partner and asking her about what she did.
    After comparing codes, I was able to fix the problems I had and get it to properly work.
    The results of this lab can be found below under where it says "Script Output".
    Clicking the button should bring up the alert. The code that was used for this
    lab can be found in the javascript console as well. </p>
