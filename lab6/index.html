<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Task 1 of this lab proved to be a challenge with the javascript console in
the browser. This was primarily due to the myMainRide object. It was pretty
difficult to enter all of the elements in correctly. So I tested out the parts
I was unsure about in a separate tab and quickly figured it out.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>I didn't really have any problems with this assignment, although it was a
	challenge. I feel like I learned a lot from the failures of lab 5 and adapted.
That made this lab so much easier for me to complete.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, this lab came out very well. I was able to get everything working
	properly with the html, css, and javascript files.</p>
